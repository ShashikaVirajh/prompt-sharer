## Motivation

- This project was developed as a reference project to learn next js basics. This is a fullstack application.
- Tried to provide a complete but simple example for the developers who are new to next js.
- This was created on the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk next js course by JavaScript Mastery.
- Backend is 100% similar to this course. But the frontend is fully typescript. Components and pages were arragned in a better way.

## Installation Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashikaVirajh/react-nextjs-prompt-sharer.git
cd react-nextjs-prompt-sharer
pnpm install
```

- To start the server after installation, run

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Tech Stack Used

Typescript - frontend of this fullstack application uses typescript
Fetch - to make API requests
Next-Auth - to handle authentication
MongoDB - As the DBMS
Express - For backend routing

## Future Enhancements

- Adding MUI to the application.
- Writing unit tests.
- Configuring prettier, eslint and husky.
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline using github actions.
- Setting up storybook.
- Validating env variables using zod.
